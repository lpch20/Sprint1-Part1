            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br />
            never written a line of code. I needed<br />
            some structure trom professionals<br />
            who can help me learn programming<br />
            step by step. I was encouraged to<br />
            enroll by a former student of theirs<br />
            who can only say wonderful things<br />
            about the program. The entire<br />
            curriculum and staff did not<br />
            disappoint. They were very hands-on<br />
            and I never had to wait long for<br />
            assistance. The agile team project, in<br />
            particular. was outstanding. It took<br />
            my learning to the next level in a way<br />
            that no tutorial could ever have. In<br />
            fact. rve often referred to it during<br />
            interviews as an example of my<br />
            developent experience. It certainly<br />
            helped me land a job as a full-stack<br />
            developer after receiving multiple<br />
            offers, 100% recommend!"<br />
